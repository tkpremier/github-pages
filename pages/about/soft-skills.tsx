              "Task". Job interview candidates who describe a "Target" they set themselves instead of an externally
              imposed "Task" emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance

                midterms were approaching and didn't have time to produce the mockups. Our front-end person was rushing
                him for the mockups so that he could proceed with his work, and that was stressing the designer out. The
                atmosphere in the team was tense."

                "I spoke to the front-end developer to ask him why he was rushing the designer for the designs. He said
                that he wanted the designs early because it would be a waste of time rebuilding if the designer designed
                something different eventually. I explained to him that the midterm dates were out of the designer's
                control and we had to be more understanding about each other's schedules. I spoke to the designer to get
                a rough idea of what he had in mind and asked him when he could commit to producing the high-fidelity
                designs. He replied that he could start on them as soon as his midterms were over. I explained to him
                why the front-end developer was pushing him for the mockups, and that the front-end developer had no ill
                intentions and simply wanted the project to succeed. As someone with some experience in UI/UX design, I
                came up with wireframe mocks, ran them by the designer for approval, then passed them to the front-end
                developer to start building. I encouraged the front-end developer to use placeholders and not be too
                concerned about the details for now. We could build the non-UI parts first (authentication, hook up with
                APIs) and tweak pixels and add polish later on. The front-end developer agreed and went ahead with the
                approach. I explained to the front-end developer that the designer will pass us the mockups after his
                midterm, by date."

                marks for the project and became a great team."
